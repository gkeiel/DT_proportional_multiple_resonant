# DT_proportional_multiple_resonant

A code to compute discrete-time proportional_multiple_resonant (PMR) controller and current feedback gain in order to ensure UPS closed-loop stability and performance. PMR and current gains tunned by means of LMI approach with pole placement constraints. Minor modifications can be made to deal with robustness problem and more advanced performance restrictions.
